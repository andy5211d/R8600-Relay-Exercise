A Processing sketch to exercise the relays in an ICOM R8600 radio.
Uses a config file so user can change the paramaters to match their set-up.  
Note: My R8600 address is not the default so you may have to change the 
address in the json file to match your settings.

The programe will step through the frequency table and then the attenuator
table and then loop four times.  Most paramaters are user adjustable in the 
json config file.  Uses generic ICOM IC-V commands so should work with
other ICOM radios.

Thanks to John Rowing for the idea.
