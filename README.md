A Processing sketch to exercise the relays in an ICOM R8600 radio.
Uses a config file so user can change the paramaters to match their set-up.  
Note my R8600 address is not the default so you may have to change the 
address in the json file to match your settings.
Should work with other ICOM radios with approporate changes in config.json.
Thanks to John Rowing for the idea.
